* Overall Status: On-Track
Team has started microservice architecture. Starting to implement a
microservice and having set up all the tools to start writing
one. They will continue more work on this next week. May need to start
another one or two soon. Front end mock ups have been created and look
good for now. Future changes may be needed depending on software
implementation issues. They will start making parts of that
next. Other than that they will start setting up Kubernetes to run the
servers, front end, and database.
