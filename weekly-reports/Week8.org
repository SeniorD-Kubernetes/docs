* Overall Status: Behind schedule
  Progress was made significantly in the back end, but I was hoping to
  see something in the front end this time. They showed me a working
  auth but it was through curl requests rather than a
  UI. Unfortunately I was asking for a front end showing, and they
  hopefully can show me a lot of progress next week in that regard.
