* Overall Status: On Schedule
  Team again could not meet this week as it was a Monday schedule this
  Tuesday, however, I did get to meet with a team member and catch
  up. They have fixed some bugs, cleaned up code, and showcased a new
  ui. New routes and route fixes are still in progress but they are
  almost done. I look forward to seeing future progress and a demo
  soon.
