* First MVP(Minimal Viable Product)
** C++ Grading Environment
** Front End/Backend
*** A simple upload for zipped code files.
*** A simple upload for a  bash test script to test the code.
*** A way to limit the number of submissions.
*** A display of the results from running the testcript.
* Break Down
** Grading Environment
*** Probably the most difficult part of this.
*** K8 needs to be able to automatically create jobs for this enviornment.
**** That way when different people upload their code they each get their own environment.
*** We need to be able to reproducibly build this environmnet. Preferably automatically.
**** Meaning we need to write a K8 interface service.
**** This will be done in go so as to easily intergrate with our backend.
*** Needs to have all tools available to run test script and code.
** UI
*** The easiest part of this.
*** Just a simple form page that handles accepting of appropiate file types and sends them to our backend service.
** Backend
*** We need a few things here.
*** Something to tell K8 when to run a job.
*** Checking correct file types.
*** Handles submissions and limits them.
