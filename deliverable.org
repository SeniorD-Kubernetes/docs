* Project Name Background
  Tyr (pronounced /teer/) is the Nordic god who presides over matters of law, justice
  and wisdom. This name is befitting to our project as we provide
  a strict grading service that will uphold the rules set by 
  educators in their test scripts. In addition, 
  Tyr can be viewed as a pun of the word tear (like teardrop), as the students 
  will be sad when their code fails the test cases.
* Introduction
** About
   Tyr is a web application that helps educators assess student
   assignments on a scalable, fault tolerant, and uniform testing
   environment. The professor or educator will write a script to gauge
   the correctness of user submitted code.  The students will upload
   their submissions and run the professor defined tests on their
   code, in a unified environment via a web interface. Tyr differentiates 
   itself from other grading services with its complex management of 
   ephermal single-use containers. The utilization of
   containers provides a few key features:

   1. Fault tolerance: Improper code will not take down the whole server
   2. Scalability: Tyr is able to handle many clients
   3. Uniformity: Every container environment will be the same

   In the back end, Tyr manages a collection of microservices to create
   identical and ephemeral testing environments via a Kubernetes cluster
   hosted on Google Cloud.  For the front end, Tyr provides a web
   interface (https://tyr.tools) to upload code to be processed.
** Similar tools
   + Mimir - a scaling platform for testing class room code.
     + What makes ours different is we our aiming our tool for more than
     just classrooms.
     + We are aiming to make Tyr have plugins to other CMS APIs such as
     the Canvas CMS.
     + They have set languages. We are making it so we have predefined
     languages but a user can easily add a new language from the web
     interface easily.
   + Codio - An online IDE with a terminal to interface with code.
     + This requires users to use a terminal. While ours is a web
       interface with a easy-to-use GUI.
     + Ideally we will be able to add a terminal interface, but only when
       wanted.
   + repl.it - A online IDE that supports many languages.
     + They are an IDE which could be used to run code consistently, but
       we want a platform to test code, not develop.
     + Users would be able to see test cases or a tester would have to
       upload everyone's files themself after using another service to
       have them handed in.

** Team Members
   Below is the list of Team Members and roles. The roles were more
   needed for the Senior D requirement. In actuality all team members
   work collaboratively on all parts.

* Delegation of Tasks/Completion Schedule
  We are using an agile development system as it allows us to work
  more concurrently on project flow.  To do this we use a Trello Board
  with Esprint planning. Which you can find

* Components
  This section will be expanded as we work through several stages of
  MVPs.
** Backend: APIs for front end to interact with.
*** Determine if submission of code is of proper type.
**** Can specify type of submission such as zip, tar.gz, etc.
**** We need to correctly identity that the submission is of the correct type.
*** Limit Number of Submissions
**** If specified we need to limit the number of submissions to test allowed.
*** Need service to relay output.
**** An Api that formats stdout in a specific format to send to front end.
*** Make a call to Kubernetes to spin up job upon submission.
**** Need a service that interacts with Kubernetes.
**** Needs to be able to know which job it should be spinning up.
*** Logging
**** For Admin purposes we need proper log outputs that are easy to read.
**** Also needs to integrate into any service.
** Frontend: The interactive elements of our application
*** A simple form page Mock up.
**** Must have submission upload.
**** Test script Upload.
**** Gives message for incorrect submission upload.
**** Gives message for max number of attempts reached.
**** Displays number of attempts left.
*** A list of image of the current mock up is located below.

*** A list of UI flows

    This section is meant to show where each button/element takes you
    in the application. Some flows are purposefully left out because
    they are obvious, and take up unnecessary space, such as any file
    upload/download button, or navigating to login/signup from the
    homepage, etc.

    The application has some screens that although serve the same
    purpose, are different in appearance for Students and Professors
    in order to allow for each role to perform different tasks.

** Kubernetes: The scaling and environment builder
*** Need a C++ Environment that can run shell test scripts (First MVP).
**** Requires setting up Kubernetes infrastructure.
***** There's a lot of work to this even though it sounds simple.
**** The ability to spin up jobs per user.
     
* Project Timeline
  Here is our timeline of what we expect to have done.

  + First MVP (Fall Semester): To have a small demo web app that only
    accepts very specific code types and test scripts.
  + Second MVP
    + Having a more extended web app where we can have users create
      assignments and pick a programming language.
  + Final Product
    + Having hopefully our final product finished. Where adding a
      programming language can easily be added, we accept many file
      types and we are fully scalable. Hopefully we can give users a
      terminal interface through our web page as well.
